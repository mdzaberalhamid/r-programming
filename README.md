Welcome to the **R Programming** repository! ðŸŽ¯

This repository is dedicated to my learning journey with **R**, one of the most powerful languages for **data analysis, statistics, and data visualization**. Here, youâ€™ll find scripts, projects, and exercises that I create while exploring R programming concepts and techniques.

## Repository Structure

The repository may include:

* **Basics** â€“ Fundamental concepts like variables, data types, operators, and functions.
* **Data Manipulation** â€“ Using packages like `dplyr` and `tidyr` for handling datasets.
* **Data Visualization** â€“ Creating plots with `ggplot2` and other visualization tools.
* **Statistical Analysis** â€“ Implementing statistical methods, tests, and models.
* **Projects** â€“ Practical projects demonstrating R applications in real-world scenarios.
* **Resources** â€“ Notes, cheat sheets, and useful links for learning R.

## Getting Started

To run the scripts in this repository:

1. Install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
2. (Optional) Install RStudio for a better development environment: [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).
3. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/r-programming.git
   ```
4. Open R or RStudio and start exploring the scripts.

## Learning Goals

Through this repository, I aim to:

* Build a strong foundation in R programming.
* Learn to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data efficiently.
* Apply statistical methods to real-world datasets.
* Create reproducible R projects and reports.
